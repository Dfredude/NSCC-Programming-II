/* Create an application that prompts an employee for an hourly pay rate and number of hours worked. 
Compute their gross pay (hours times rate), withholding tax, and net pay (gross pay minus withholding tax). 
Withholding tax is computed as a percentage of gross pay based on the following: 

Gross Pay ($)                                          Withholding (%)
0 to 450.00                                                10
450.01 to 600.00                                           12
600.01 to 1000.00                                          15
1000.01 and over                                           20
